# My Personal Portfolio Website

## About

### Description

I am a Junior Web Developer currently working on smaller, freelance projects while looking for a fixed, full-time position,

### The Mission

I needed a Website where I could introduce myself, outline my technical skills, and showcase examples of my work. I had previously made a [portfolio website](https://acz1992.github.io/adam-zdan-portfolio-first-iteration/index.html) in order to practice Vanilla JavaScript, but needed a more professional looking website in order to really sell myself. 

## Tech / Resources

### Stack

This company website project uses Next.js 14, JavaScript and Tailwind CSS. It was also my first time using the Framer-Motion library in order to create engaging transitions and animations.
